# webcomic.js

Webcomic.js is an open-source framework to help you publish webcomics online using state-of-the-art web technology!  It's way under construction right now.

## Installing

Until this is re-released as a node module, it has to be cloned from Github:

	git clone https://github.com/das-aiya/webcomic.js
	npm install
	npm start

## How it works

There are some sample images in the public/pages folder, with names like 1.png and 5.jpg.  Adding similarly numbered images will automatically add them to your website!

## Is tha it?

Here's the current todo list for more features:

- add page description with markdown support
- add an upload/download/modify api
- re-release as a Node.js module!

Webcomic.js is currently under early-stage, pre-alpha development, so hold your horses, okay?
