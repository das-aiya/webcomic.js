# webcomic.js

Webcomic.js is an open-source framework to help you publish webcomics online using state-of-the-art web technology!  It's way under construction right now.

	git clone https://github.com/das-aiya/webcomic.js
	npm install
	npm start

There are some sample images in the public/pages folder, with names like 1.png and 5.jpg.  Adding similarly numbered images will automatically add them to your website!

Here's the current todo list for more features:

- add page description with markdown support
- add an upload/download/modify api
- re-release as a Node.js module!
